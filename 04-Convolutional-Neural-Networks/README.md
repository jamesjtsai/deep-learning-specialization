#### Overview: Convolutional Neural Networks

Week | Learning Objectives
------------ | -------------
1 | Understand the convolution operation. Understand the pooling operation. Remember the vocabulary used in convolutional neural network (padding, stride, filter, ...). Build a convolutional neural network for image multi-class classification.
2 | Understand multiple foundational papers of convolutional neural networks. Analyze the dimensionality reduction of a volume in a very deep network. Understand and Implement a Residual network. Build a deep neural network using Keras. Implement a skip-connection in your network. Clone a repository from github and use transfer learning.
3 | Understand the challenges of Object Localization, Object Detection and Landmark Finding. Understand and implement non-max suppression. Understand and implement intersection over union. Understand how we label a dataset for an object detection application. Remember the vocabulary of object detection (landmark, anchor, bounding box, grid, ...).
4 | Discover how CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition. Implement your own algorithm to generate art and recognize faces!
